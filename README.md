Inspiration:
I wanted to make a supermario type game where you had to jump over objects and get to a finish line to win. But then I decided to simplify that to the basics to just making it a jump game. Similar to the one the Dinosaur game you could play on Google Chrome. 

Directions:
Use your mouse to click to jump over the square. Everytime you jump over the square you get a point. If you hit the square, you lose the game.

Code:
I created variables for the neon red block, the yellow character, and the score. Used an event listener in order for the click of the mouse to coorelate to a jump. I used a keyframes animation in my styles.css for the jump to go up 50px and back down. Then I created another function that will remove jump when the animation ends.
